# Bachelor Thesis: Automated classification of crowdsourcing contributions by machine learning
This model was developed in the context of my bachelor thesis. From more than 30 features, 12 features were selected below to determine a good quality crowdsourcing contribution.

### Abstract of my Bachelor Thesis:
Crowdsourcing is a new innovative form of a web-based business model and involves the work of a company or institution, outsourced to a distributed group of people over a network or platform, in the format of an open call. The manual review and classification of large amounts of unstructured data, such as solutions, ideas or feedback, is an enormous challenge for companies. It is usually a time-consuming and resource-intensive process. The results of this work show that it is possible to reliably classify and predict the quality of crowdsourcing contributions using text mining techniques and machine learning based on textual properties. The length of a contribution as a characteristic plays the most important role.
